# BinarySearchTree

This is binary search tree implemented in Java without libraries.  
The Node class represents a single node in the tree, with a key value and pointers to left and right child nodes. 
The Tree class includes methods for insertion, search, and printing the tree in the console.
The insertion method inserts into the tree in an orderly manner, maintaining the binary search tree property. Meanwhile, the search method utilizes binary search for efficiency. 

## Screenshots  

In the example, the numbers 4, 2, 6, 0, and 8 are inserted into the tree, followed by 7, 9, 1, and 3. The resulting tree is properly ordered and contains all of the added values. Overall, the implementation provides a modular and efficient way to represent and manipulate binary trees in Java.
